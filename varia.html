{% include gallery id="gallery_railay" caption="Railay Beach, Thailand" %}

<p>First time climbing outside on the <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/thailand/krabi/area/15687337">One-Two-Three</a> wall.
  The routes were mostly around 5a so even with only a few months of bouldering practice before we managed to flash/onsight
them. Of course the 35C weather and 20m of height still meant hardcore palm sweat and an unforgettable experience overall.</p>
