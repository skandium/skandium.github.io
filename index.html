<h1>Short version</h1>

I'm a human being located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn">Tallinn</a> (59.437° N, 24.754° E).

<p>
    I am interested in machine learning applications with a real world impact. Previously I've worked for 5 years at
    <a href="https://bolt.eu">Bolt</a> where I was the group tech lead of the data science domain (around 50 scientists).
    Before that, I helped to kickstart data science teams in <a href="https://proekspert.com">Proekspert</a> and
    <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/investorise">Investorise</a>. My educational background is in
    econometrics and economic theory.

<p>
    Besides machine learning, some other things I enjoy include:
</p>

<p>
    &#127939; long distance running and road cycling <br>
    &#128218; hunting for vintage editions at the neighbourhood book market <br>
    &#128214; binge reading Wikipedia at 1AM <br>
    &#127963; discussing political science and economics over a beer <br>
    &#128054; petting doggos
