<h1>Short version</h1>

I'm a human being located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn">Tallinn</a> (59.437° N, 24.754° E).

<p>
    Some things I enjoy:
</p>

<p>
    &#129302; making machines learn <br>
    &#9968; cycling, hiking, rock climbing, swimming, running <br>
    &#129488; adhering to Stoic philosophy <br>
    &#128218; hunting for vintage editions at the neighbourhood book market <br>
    &#128214; binge reading history on Wikipedia at 1AM <br>
    &#127963; discussing political science and economics over a beer <br>
    &#128054; petting doggos
</p>


<h1>Long version</h1>

<p>Back in university days I was always bewildered by how little different folks using data knew of each other.
    Whether it was my friends in social sciences analysing survey results with ANOVA using the IBM SPSS software or
    statisticians doing distributional modelling based on different assumptions or my econometrics professor who knew
    the proof of the Gauss-Markov theorem by heart or the AI guys claiming their deep learning
    was going to make the rest of science redundant, it always seemed like different faces of the same beast to me.
</p>

<p>
    Whenever I asked one of these about the others, e.g. my econometrics professor about why we do not use neural
    networks or the AI guys about endogeneity and spurious correlations in the observational
    data, they couldn't tell me. This implanted a deep dissatisfaction in me, and has probably
    affected my career development as an empiricist and a data generalist - someone interested in all the tricks one can
    do using data, regardless of the domain.
</p>

<p> I'm an applied economist by education, having done my Master's in
    <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.econdept.html">Toulouse School of Economics.</a> At some point in my
    life I was seriously considering an academic career in Economics and even got admitted to a funded PhD programme
    in the US, but around the same time I became interested in machine learning and its applications in the tech
    industry, which caused me to drop out already before starting.

<p>After school I was lucky to receive a data lead role from <a href="https://proekspert.com/">Proekspert</a> where in
    a year's time we established a functioning data science team that worked on a range of topics such as industrial
    automation, churn analytics and smart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">controllers</a>. Here I
    learned the importance of processes, proper tooling and planning to guide the sometimes chaotic data science
    workflow.
</p>

<p>Next, I worked as the head of data science for a US based real estate analytics startup. There, I drove the
    research roadmap revolving around everything topics such as time series forecasting at scale, portfolio optimisation
    (over a set of poorly defined instruments, which made off the shelf solutions not applicable) and trying to cluster
    neighbourhoods in a way that they would overlap with people's intuitive understanding. </p>

<p>Currently I'm working in a senior individual contributor role at <a href="https://medium.com/bolt-labs">Bolt</a>
    where I've
    contributed to a few models running at scale in real time: dynamic pricing, fleet optimisation, routing and search
    experience enhancement. These days I'm mostly working on routing related stuff, making use of machine learning to
    capture the probabilistic nature of traffic.</p>
